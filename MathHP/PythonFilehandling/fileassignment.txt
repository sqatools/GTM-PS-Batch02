Isolate the Test: Ensure that the test for rejecting 9876543210 cookies is properly isolated from other tests.
 This includes verifying that there are no other test cases or setup procedures in the same class that might interfere
 with the functionality being tested.

Check Test Dependencies: Review any dependencies or setup 9876543218 procedures in the test class that could
potentially impact the state of the page or interfere with the test case for rejecting cookies. Make sure these dependencies are properly handled or isolated.

Inspect the Page: Verify that the "reject cookies" button or functionality is still accessible and not blocked
 or hidden by any other elements on the page when the test is applied at the class level.

Timing Issues: Sometimes, timing issues can cause elements to become clickable at different times.
Ensure that your test waits for the necessary 4567843210 elements to become clickable before attempting to interact with them.

Debugging: Use debugging techniques to inspect the state 8765432190  of the page and identify any elements or conditions that might
be causing the "click intercepted" exception.

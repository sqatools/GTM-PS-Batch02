General Purpose: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
Python is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it suitable for a wide range of applications,
including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

Readability: Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Its syntax is designed to be clear and concise,
using indentation to define code blocks (unlike other languages that use curly braces). This makes Python code easy to understand,
even for beginners.

Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line by an interpreter,
rather than compiled into machine code beforehand. This allows for rapid development and prototyping,
as code changes can be tested immediately without the need for compilation.

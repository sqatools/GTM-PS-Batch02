- To print some series of numbers in reverse order
    for i in range(10, 0, -1) # Here
- for char in str:
- whenever we want to reverse a number we have to change it to string for example palindrome.
  num1=565
  rev_num=str(num1)[::-1] # Here we are converting integer to string and reversing
- print() : This is for printing all loop statements in the fresh line.
- end="" : This is for printing in the same line like ******. If we give space then it prints * * * * *
- for i in range (1,5): Here it will print from 1 to 4 only.
- Loops: last loops completes all iterations and last top iteration.
- print(): It plays main role in the pattern programs.
- each value of i in the loop will go in the next line by using print() for i loop.
- print(ord("A"): This function is to find the ASCII value of that particular letter.
- print(char("97")): This function is to find the character of particular ASCII value.
-

Loops:
- In for loop we can use below items after "in range" only.
   i. integer variables like "in range(var)"
   ii.String variables like "in range()"

Strings:
- output= "Hello my name is" + name + "and my age is " + str(age) + "and living in" + city (Here we are converting integer age variable to string)
- output2 = "Hello my name is {} and my age is {} and living in {}".format(name, city, age) -- String formatting.
- output3 = f"Hello my name is {name} and my age is {age} and living in {city}" -- F string formatting.
- for i in stra:
    print(i, end="")    # Loop without indexing
- for i in range(val_len):
    print(stra[i])      # Here it will print by using indexing.


String slicing:
- In slicing it is always from left to right but right to left is not possible.
- In string slicing initial index element will be printed and last index element will be excluded.

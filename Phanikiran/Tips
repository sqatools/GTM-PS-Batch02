- To print some series of numbers in reverse order
    for i in range(10, 0, -1) # Here
- for char in str:
- whenever we want to reverse a number we have to change it to string for example palindrome.
  num1=565
  rev_num=str(num1)[::-1] # Here we are converting integer to string and reversing
- print() : This is for printing all loop statements in the fresh line.
- end="" : This is for printing in the same line like ******. If we give space then it prints * * * * *
- for i in range (1,5): Here it will print from 1 to 4 only.
- Loops: last loops completes all iterations and last top iteration.
- print(): It plays main role in the pattern programs.
- each value of i in the loop will go in the next line by using print() for i loop.
- print(ord("A"): This function is to find the ASCII value of that particular letter.
- print(char("97")): This function is to find the character of particular ASCII value.
- In python each python file is called as module

Loops:
- In for loop we can use below items after "in range" only.
   i. integer variables like "in range(var)"
   ii.String variables like "in range()"
-     for key, value in kwargs.items(): # Here **kwargs parameter will take the values in the form of key and value.
        print(key, ":", value)  # It prints key and value format.It will be used for dictionary.
- In order to display all the dictionary values in the form key and values by using for as below
    for key, value in abc.item():
        print(key,value)


Strings:
- output= "Hello my name is" + name + "and my age is " + str(age) + "and living in" + city (Here we are converting integer age variable to string)
- output2 = "Hello my name is {} and my age is {} and living in {}".format(name, city, age) -- String formatting.
- output3 = f"Hello my name is {name} and my age is {age} and living in {city}" -- F string formatting.
- for i in stra:
    print(i, end="")    # Loop without indexing
- for i in range(val_len):
    print(stra[i])      # Here it will print by using indexing.


String slicing:
- In slicing it is always from left to right but right to left is not possible.
- In string slicing initial index element will be printed and last index element will be excluded.



Functions:
- Python file is called as a module and directory is called as package.
- addition(2,4) # passing data to parameters with pass by value.
- addition(x,y) # passing data to parameters with pass by reference.
- division(var1=30, var2=10): division(2) # op:5  Here when we provide single value in called function then it will assign to first arguement in
  defined function.(It doesn't matter how many arguments are declared ).
- always non default parameters resides first and default parameters comes in the end.
- "from pythonfunction import addition" (Here pythonfunction is package and addition is method) : Here we used in the same package.
- "from pythonfunction.function import *" : Here we are importing all the modules inside of that directory.
- * args : This is used for passing multiple values to single parameter in the functions.
- square_value(var1, *args, var2)
     square_value(2,4,3,4,3,5,var2=6) # Here 2 will be assigned to var1 and 6 will be assigned to var2, remaining will assign to args.
- **kwargs - This parameter accepts in the form of dictionary like key: value [Ex: name: "phani"]

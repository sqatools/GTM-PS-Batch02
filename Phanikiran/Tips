- To print some series of numbers in reverse order
    for i in range(10, 0, -1) # Here
- for char in str:
- whenever we want to reverse a number we have to change it to string for example palindrome.
  num1=565
  rev_num=str(num1)[::-1] # Here we are converting integer to string and reversing
- print() : This is for printing all loop statements in the fresh line.
- end="" : This is for printing in the same line like ******. If we give space then it prints * * * * *
- for i in range (1,5): Here it will print from 1 to 4 only.
- Loops: last loops completes all iterations and last top iteration.
- print(): It plays main role in the pattern programs.
- each value of i in the loop will go in the next line by using print() for i loop.
- print(ord("A"): This function is to find the ASCII value of that particular letter.
- print(char("97")): This function is to find the character of particular ASCII value.
